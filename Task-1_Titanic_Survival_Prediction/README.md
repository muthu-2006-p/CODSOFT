# Task-1: Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Use machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using a dataset of passenger details.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic Dataset from Kaggle or open sources
- Features: Age, Gender, Fare, Pclass, etc.

## ðŸ§  ML Algorithms Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Decision Tree

Each algorithm provides:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Survival Predictions
- Visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, tree diagram)

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations Included
- Survival Count (Bar Plot)
- Age vs Survival (Histogram)
- Confusion Matrix (Heatmap)
- Decision Tree Diagram

## âœ… Output
Each model is trained and tested separately. Accuracy is compared and results are visualized clearly.
